# GBS2map
____

### workflow and tool-set to construct genetic maps from GBS data

#### needed input:  
  * demultiplexed GBS sequenced from a mapping population   
  * reference genome (draft genome)
  
#### output: 
* markers based on sequences of the reference genome
* genetic map

* sequences anchored to linkage groups
